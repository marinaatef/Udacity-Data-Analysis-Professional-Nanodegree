# Explore-US-BikeShare-Data

In this project, I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, 
and Washington. I write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
